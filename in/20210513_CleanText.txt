sometimes you've got to be able to listen to yourself and be okay with no one else understanding
the voice there is a voice inside of you that whispers all day long i feel this is right for me i know that this is wrong no teacher preacher parent friend or wise man can decide what's right for youjust listen to the voice that speaks inside
listen to yourself and in that quietude you might hear the voice of god
that choice is the only one that you really have to make to listen to yourself above anybody else and to trust yourself enough to hear what you're saying
listen to yourself
it is good to listen to yourself
listen to yourself every day
